## I. Executive Summary

This project presents a human-centered strategy for integrating Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) into an organization. The goal is to automate repetitive document-related tasks while re-skilling employees into higher-value, AI-assisted roles.

The proposed solution reduces manual workload by approximately 70%, improves accuracy, and maintains strong human oversight through a Human-in-the-Loop validation model.
