# Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) – Human-Centered AI Strategy

This repository demonstrates a simplified Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) system combined with a Human-in-the-Loop validation approach.

The project simulates how AI can automate document processing while employees transition into validation and supervision roles instead of being replaced.
